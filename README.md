Sign Language Detection using CNN
This project implements a Sign Language Detection model that identifies the letter signed using three different models: KNN (K-nearest neighbors), Logistic Regression, and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Among these, the CNN model provides the best performance.

Project Structure
Data Collection: We aquired the data from kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist.
Preprocessing: Scaling and normalizing images.
Model Training: Training three different models - KNN, Logistic Regression, and CNN.
Evaluation: Comparing the performance of the models.
Why CNN is the Best for This Task
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how CNNs work for sign language detection:

Input Layer:

Takes an image of a hand signing a letter.
Convolutional Layers:

These layers apply filters to the input image to create feature maps.
Filters can detect features such as edges, textures, and patterns specific to the sign language letters.
Activation Function:

Usually, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is applied to introduce non-linearity.
This helps the network learn complex patterns.
Pooling Layers:

Pooling (like max pooling) reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
It retains the most important information, making the model more efficient and less sensitive to small translations of the input.
Fully Connected Layers:

These layers interpret the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers.
They combine these features to predict the probability of each possible letter.
Output Layer:

Produces the final classification result, identifying which letter is being signed.
Comparison with KNN and Logistic Regression
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):

KNN classifies a letter based on the closest examples in the training data.
It doesn’t perform as well because it doesn’t effectively handle the high dimensionality of image data.
Logistic Regression:

Logistic Regression is a linear model, which means it struggles with the complex patterns in image data.
It doesn’t capture spatial hierarchies as CNNs do.
CNN:

CNNs are designed to handle image data effectively.
They automatically learn and extract features from images, making them highly accurate for tasks like sign language detection.
